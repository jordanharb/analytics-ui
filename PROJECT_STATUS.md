# Analytics UI - Project Status

## ✅ Successfully Completed

### 1. **Project Setup**
- Created React + TypeScript app with Vite
- Installed all required dependencies (Mapbox, Supabase, Tailwind, etc.)
- Configured environment variables with provided API keys

### 2. **Mapbox Integration** 
- Successfully integrated Mapbox GL JS with your token
- Implemented clustering with custom styles
- Added interactive features (click handlers, popups, hover effects)
- Created KPI strip showing metrics

### 3. **Supabase Backend Connection**
- Set up Supabase client with your project credentials
- Created typed RPC wrappers for all SQL endpoints
- Implemented error handling and request cancellation

### 4. **TypeScript API Architecture**
- Complete type definitions matching SQL backend exactly
- Analytics client with all required methods
- Filter types with proper structure
- Event, Entity, and Export types

### 5. **Core Files Created**

## 🚀 Current State

**The application is running at http://localhost:5173**

- Map renders successfully with Mapbox
- Connects to Supabase backend
- Fetches and displays real event data
- Shows clustering and city markers
- Displays KPI metrics

## 📋 Ready for Next Phase

The foundation is complete. The next steps from the implementation plan:

1. **Add Side Panel** - For city/cluster event lists
2. **Create Filter Panel** - With all filter options from backend
3. **Add Routing** - Multiple views (Map/Directory/Entity)
4. **Implement Pagination** - Keyset-based infinite scroll
5. **Add Event Details** - Expandable cards with posts

## 🔧 How to Test

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. You should see:
   - Interactive USA map
   - Blue markers for cities with events
   - Clusters that expand on zoom
   - KPI metrics in top-left corner
   - Click any marker for city details

## 📝 Notes

- All API keys are properly configured
- The Mapbox token has full access as requested
- Supabase connection is established
- TypeScript types match SQL functions exactly
- Ready for team development or AI agent continuation

The implementation plan (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) contains the complete roadmap for finishing all features.
